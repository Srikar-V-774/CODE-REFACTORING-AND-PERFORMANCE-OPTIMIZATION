##In Task-4 of my internship, I worked on refactoring and optimizing a simple open-source project called “Text Analyzer.” The original script was a single unstructured Python file that read a text file and performed basic analysis such as counting words, characters, and sentences, as well as finding the most common word and average word length. While functional, the code was inefficient and difficult to read, with repetitive loops and no modularity.
To improve it, I refactored the entire codebase by organizing it into clear, reusable functions like count_words, count_characters, and most_common_word, and replaced manual operations with Python’s built-in, high-performance tools. I used collections.Counter for fast word frequency counting, sum() with list comprehensions for character counts, and with open() for safer file handling. These changes significantly improved readability, reduced code duplication, and boosted performance.
I also structured the script with a clean analyze() function that integrates all processing steps, making the code scalable and easier to maintain. The refactored version ran faster and was shorter and cleaner than the original. It can now be reused with any text file, extended with new features, or integrated into larger applications with ease. The overall performance improved by reducing unnecessary loops and leveraging optimized data structures.
The report included with this project details each change made and explains its impact on performance and maintainability. Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in writing clean, efficient code, understanding the importance of modularity, and thinking like a professional developer. This project taught me how thoughtful refactoring can enhance the quality of software without changing its output. Task-4 was a great opportunity to apply real-world best practices in code design and optimization, and I successfully transformed a basic script into a production-ready tool that is faster, neater, and more scalable.##
