TASK 4: CODE REFACTORING AND PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

Project: Text Analyzer  

Objective:
Refactor an open-source Text Analyzer to improve readability and performance.

BEFORE (unclear texter.py):
One big script with no functions.
Manual counting with loops and duplicate code.
Not reusable or readable.
Most common word calculated with a slow custom loop.

AFTER (clear texter.py):
Separated logic into clear functions.
Used Pythonâ€™s built-in Counter for fast word frequency.
-Used list comprehensions and sum() for speed and simplicity.
Used with open() for safe file reading.
Replaced nested loops with efficient code.
Better variable names and structure.

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
Faster: Used built-in functions like sum() and Counter.
Cleaner: Modular functions improve readability and reuse.
Scalable: Code can now analyze any file, easily extendable.
Maintainable: Easy to debug, test, and expand.

Final Result:
Code is now faster, shorter, easier to understand, and more professional.
